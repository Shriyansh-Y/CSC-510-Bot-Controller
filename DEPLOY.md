[]()

##### Steps to run the scripts:




### Acceptance Testing:

##### The Droid Bot:
Droid is an Android library recommender Bot that analyzes Android code from a given github repositoy and recommends Android libraries that can be used in the code. Thus, the Droid Bot suggests libraries which can help improve the quality of your code.


We have deployed the Droid bot to the following Slack channel](). For the purpose of testing, We have created two dummy users. The credentials for the dummy users are as follows:
for The Use cases for the Bot are as follows:

| User ID     | Password      | Slack user name |
| ------------- | ------------|-----------------| 
|               |             |                 |
|               |             |                 |

Log into the channel given above using any of the login credentials.

###### General Instructions:

1. For the purpose of testing, we used a sample Android application. The github repository containing the code for this sample application can be found [here](https://github.com/joshio1/DroidRecommenderAndroidSample). Thus, you can use this sample github repository as an input to the Droid Bot while testing.

2. As mentioned above, we have depolyed our Droid Bot on an Amazon EC2 instance. In order to improve our messaging with the Bot, we have added a slack application instead of a Bot user. We have added the Bot application to our [slack team](https://se-bot-project.slack.com/messages/D7NNV7X44/). Login into this slack team using the credentials mentioned above.

3. We have created a channel- [droid_test]() for communicating with the Droid Recommender Bot. Now, we invited the Droid Recommender Bot to this channel by typing the following:

```
/invite @Droid Recommender
```
